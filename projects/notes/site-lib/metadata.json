- Sound Engineering Introduction","icon":"","description":"Hello, my name is Corbin Whitton. I’m a software engineer, audio engineer, composer, producer, musician, among other things. I am so excited to share my passion for music ministry and helping you expand your skillset in this area.I’ve been working in the IT field since the late aughts (the decade from 2000-2009). I’ve owned and operated a company specialized in IT consulting, from Audio/Visual needs, to networking, server setup, cloud engineering, and hiring. I’ve worked with 10+ churches in the greater western USA (Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado) and have provisioned several technical systems and setups to meet the very specific needs of each church. Since my background is in IT, I cater to small churches with limited resources to maximize their utilization of the tools they already have, as well as offering several powerful alternatives to costly software and hardware.Music ministry is a form of worship and outreach. It’s not simply a performance, it’s worship, it’s passion, it’s fun.The purpose of worship is to simply praise, and glorify our God. Worship can take many forms, from singing praises, to serving our community, to even monotonous daily tasks such as mowing the lawn. At it’s simplest form, worship is glorifying God. How does Music Play into it? “He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the LORD and put their trust in him.”\nPsalm 40:3 Music, like anything we do, can be used to praise our Lord. God designed a beautiful mathematical framework for sound that allows different notes to be combined to create melodies. He created language and the ability to communicate, allowing us to create verses and lyrics. Music is just the simple combination of amplitude and pitch to produce a sound that is pleasing to the ears. Aspects of Music Ministry Musicianship - Musicians play the various different instruments to make a delightful noise. From Drums, Bass, Piano, and even vocals!\nStage Hand - Stage hands are the gears that make things work, from making sure the musicians have the support they need, to replacing cables and setting up/tearing down the setup.\nComposing/Writing - These aspects are reserved for the most creative of us, they use the tools God gave them to match together notes, giving words to melodies.\nSound Engineering - Sound engineering is the art of blending multiple inputs/outputs together and treating each audio stream as needed to make each aspect listed above perform their best. Sound is a three-dimensional air pressure wave (yes, just like water waves at the beach). We often visualize it in two-dimensions since it is more easily read and understood.<img alt=\"Untitled.png\" src=\"0-meta/assets/images/untitled.png\" target=\"_self\">\nLike the waves in water, sound is also a wave.\n<br><img alt=\"Untitled 1.png\" src=\"0-meta/assets/images/untitled-1.png\" target=\"_self\">\nA two-dimensional representation of a wave, the distance between the top (crest) and the bottom (trough) is called amplitude and is how “loud” a sound is (usually measured in Decibels dBA). The distance between the troughs or crests is the frequency, also known as the tone, or pitch.\nMusic theory is a system of rules, concepts, and practices that describe the structure and properties of music. It includes topics such as melody, harmony, rhythm, notation, and form, as well as the study of historical and cultural influences on music. Some of the basic elements of music theory include scales, chords, keys, intervals, and cadences. Understanding music theory can help musicians and composers better understand the relationships between different musical elements, which can in turn lead to more effective and expressive composition and performance.Certain notes sound good together because they have harmonious relationships with each other based on mathematical ratios and the physics of sound. In music theory, these relationships are described as intervals, which are the distances between two pitches. Harmonious intervals are typically small and based on simple ratios, such as the octave (2:1), the fifth (3:2), and the fourth (4:3). When these intervals are played together, the resulting combination of sound waves creates a pleasing and stable sensation for the listener. Additionally, the Western musical tradition has established certain chord progressions and harmonies over time through cultural and historical factors, which are widely recognized and used in many styles of music.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Introduction","level":1,"id":"Introduction_0"},{"heading":"Personal Background","level":2,"id":"Personal_Background_0"},{"heading":"What’s Music Ministry?","level":2,"id":"What’s_Music_Ministry?_0"},{"heading":"What’s the Purpose of Worship?","level":3,"id":"What’s_the_Purpose_of_Worship?_0"},{"heading":"What We Know About Sound","level":2,"id":"What_We_Know_About_Sound_0"},{"heading":"An Overview of Music Theory","level":3,"id":"An_Overview_of_Music_Theory_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"3-compendium/sound-engineering/01-sound-engineering-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["0-meta/assets/images/untitled.png","0-meta/assets/images/untitled-1.png"],"createdTime":1761405704677,"modifiedTime":1763338982310,"sourceSize":4641,"sourcePath":"3 - Compendium/Sound Engineering/01 - Sound Engineering Introduction.md","exportPath":"3-compendium/sound-engineering/01-sound-engineering-introduction.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":5,"backlinks":["0-meta/indices/sound-engineering.html"],"type":"markdown"},"3-compendium/sound-engineering/02-capturing-and-distributing-sound.html":{"title":"02 - Capturing and Distributing Sound","icon":"","description":"Instruments, microphones, cables, digital, analog, speakers. Input/output, setting up the stage, tear down Having a game plan is critical to a performance’s success. Having a plan alleviates stress, and allows for greater creativity since the bare necessities are already figured out.Some good starting questions and responses for building a plan are as follows:\nWho is performing? What inputs will they need access to? - Input Chart\nWhat technology are the performers using? Do I need DI boxes, microphones, MIDI network access? - Tech List\nWhere is the sound going? Do they need it recorded or broadcasted? - Routing &amp; Mixing\nHow much time do the performers need to prepare? When will they be arriving? When are they doing a line test or practicing? - Schedule Prepare the space: Ensure that the stage area is clean and free of any obstacles. Move any furniture, props, or other items that may be in the way.\nSet up the sound system: Assemble the sound system components, including the speakers, mixer, and any other necessary equipment. Connect all cables and make sure that everything is properly powered on.\nTest the sound system: Perform a sound check to ensure that all components of the system are working properly. Make any necessary adjustments to volume levels or other settings.\nSet up the stage lighting: Assemble any stage lighting fixtures, including stands, lights, and cables. Connect the lights to power sources and make sure that they are working properly.\nSet up the backdrop: Unroll and hang the backdrop behind the stage. Make sure that it is properly positioned and secured in place.\nArrange the stage: Place any necessary props or furniture on the stage. Make sure that everything is properly positioned and arranged in a way that is aesthetically pleasing.\nCheck the slideshow: Start the slideshow and make sure that all images, videos and texts are being displayed correctly. Ensure that the display is working properly and make any necessary adjustments.\nCheck the stage: Walk around the stage to make sure that everything is in place and working properly. Make any necessary adjustments or corrections.\nPrepare the music stand: Set up the music stand and make sure that it is in the correct position for the musicians.\nPrepare any other necessary equipment: Set up any other necessary equipment, such as microphones, instruments, or music stands. Make sure that everything is in its proper place and ready to use.\nGreet the congregation: Welcome the congregation as they arrive and help them find their seats. Make sure that everyone is comfortable and that the stage is ready for the performance.\nThis guide should provide a basic overview of the steps involved in setting up a stage for a church on Sunday mornings. It may need to be adapted or modified to fit the specific needs and requirements of your church or venue.There are three different types of microphones that are used in live performances. Each have their own uses, strengths, and weaknesses.Dynamic microphones are the most commonly used type of microphone for live performances, and are known for their robustness and durability. They work by converting sound waves into electrical signals using a diaphragm and a coil of wire that moves within a magnetic field. Dynamic microphones are often less sensitive than other types of microphones, which makes them ideal for use in high-volume settings, as they are less likely to distort or clip the input signal.Condenser microphones, on the other hand, use a thin metal diaphragm, charged with an electrical voltage, that vibrates when it is exposed to sound waves. This vibration changes the electrical capacitance of the diaphragm, which is then converted into an electrical signal. Condenser microphones are more sensitive than dynamic microphones and are often used in studios and other professional recording environments where high levels of accuracy and detail are required. Since condenser microphones are charged with an electrical voltage, external power is needed to make them function, known as Phantom Power, also denoted as +48v, which injects the power into the XLR cable.A compressor microphone is a type of condenser microphone that has an internal compressor built-in. The compressor circuit reduces the dynamic range of the microphone, which helps to reduce the volume of loud sounds and increase the volume of soft sounds. This makes compressor microphones ideal for use in situations where there are significant variations in the volume of the sound being captured, as it helps to ensure that the output signal is consistent and balanced. Since compressor microphones are condenser microphones, external power is needed to make them function, known as Phantom Power, also denoted as +48v, which injects the power into the XLR cable.Microphone Placement\nPlace microphones close to the source: Placing microphones close to the source of sound (e.g. an instrument or singer)\nUse directional microphones: Directional microphones (e.g. cardioid, supercardioid, and hypercardioid) can be used to capture sound from a specific direction and rejecting sound from other directions.\nAvoid pointing multiple microphones at the same source: Pointing multiple microphones at the same source can lead to phase cancellations and the comb filtering effect. To avoid this, try to use only one microphone or place multiple microphones at different angles to the source. If you are amplifying a choir, and have no choice but to use multiple microphones, see the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.notion.so/Technical-Excellence-Sound-Engineering-b0ff2d9d862f41a0a37f495ed201a2be?pvs=21\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.notion.so/Technical-Excellence-Sound-Engineering-b0ff2d9d862f41a0a37f495ed201a2be?pvs=21\" target=\"_self\">3:1 rule</a>.\nUse microphone isolation techniques: Microphone isolation techniques (e.g. gobos, screens, and foam shields) can help to reduce the pickup of sound from other sources\nExperiment with microphone placement: The best microphone placement will vary depending on the specific situation, so it's important to experiment with different microphone placement techniques to find the best results. Pay attention to factors such as distance, angle, and orientation to the source, and be prepared to make adjustments as needed.\nIf you’re struggling picking up the deeper, richer, low ends of a sound using a microphone, consider moving the microphone much closer to the source. As low-frequency sounds are dispersed much more easily.\n<br><img alt=\"Untitled 2.png\" src=\"0-meta/assets/images/untitled-2.png\" target=\"_self\">There are a lot of different mediums that sound can be moved from one place to another. The most used audio cables, and likely, the ones you’re most familiar with is RCA, XLR, TS/TRS, and USB cables. There are two different types of cables, digital and analog. Analog cables carry the actual noise signal, while digital cables carry bits (1s or 0s) that approximate and represent the audio signal. When and matching audio cables, converters such as Direct Injection (DI) boxes often need to be used to convert, normalize, balance, and translate one signal to another.For longer cable runs, especially parallel cables, balanced cables are far superior. This is because balanced cables have three wires, one wire carries the signal, one wire carries the same signal but with its polarity reversed so the signals cancel out (like adding +4 and -4 equals 0), and a ground wire to help shield against interference. Audio gear would just need to flip the polarity of one of the signal wires to get sound.Unbalanced cables, on the other hand have just two wires, a signal wire that carries the sound, and a ground wire. With only one signal wire, an unbalanced cable is far more susceptible to interference (can be a hum or static). Unbalanced cables are not a good idea if multiple cables are going to be ran close together.You can use a DI (direct injection) box to convert an unbalanced cable like a TS cable to a balanced cable like XLR<br><img alt=\"Untitled 3.png\" src=\"0-meta/assets/images/untitled-3.png\" target=\"_self\">Pictured is a Direct Injection (DI) box. This is a great way to connect instruments with a TS/TRS cable to a soundboard using an XLR cable. A DI box removes the noise (static) before handing the signal to the XLR cable. If there’s still noise, enable the -15db pad.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Capturing and Distributing Sound","level":1,"id":"Capturing_and_Distributing_Sound_0"},{"heading":"Before you start","level":2,"id":"Before_you_start_0"},{"heading":"Setting Up the Stage for a Live Performance","level":3,"id":"Setting_Up_the_Stage_for_a_Live_Performance_0"},{"heading":"Microphones","level":2,"id":"Microphones_0"},{"heading":"Speakers","level":2,"id":"Speakers_0"},{"heading":"Cables","level":2,"id":"Cables_0"},{"heading":"Balanced or Unbalanced?

It is advised to have a dedicated engineer for each position a production needs.\nRecording Engineer These engineers need to know their way around a mixing console, monitoring sound levels, audio equalization, routing, and need to work closely with musicians to properly capture their performance. They usually work in a recording studio to capture a performance before the mixing engineer has a chance to work with the audio.\nMixing Engineer These engineers take a recording, apply filters, effects, and audio processing to create\nMastering Engineer\nLive Sound Engineer/Front-of-House Engineer\nMultimedia Engineer\nA sound console, also known as a mixing console or mixer, is a device used to control the levels, processing, and routing of audio signals. It is an essential component in live sound reinforcement, recording studios, and broadcasting.\nScribble Strip: A scribble strip is a small label or screen that is located above or below each channel fader on a sound console. The purpose of the scribble strip is to display information about the channel and its source, such as the name of the microphone or instrument connected to the channel, and to help the sound engineer identify and manage individual channels more easily. Some digital sound consoles also allow the user to customize the scribble strip by entering custom labels or choosing from pre-defined options, making it even more useful for managing complex sound setups. If that is unavailable, never underestimate a square of masking tape and a Sharpie.\nFaders: Faders are sliding controls that adjust the volume level of a particular channel or group of channels. They are typically found in the channel strip section of a sound console and are usually positioned vertically.\nMute and Solo buttons: Mute buttons are used to temporarily turn off the audio signal of a particular channel, while solo buttons are used to temporarily isolate and listen to a single channel while muting all others.\nSelecting a channel: To select a channel on a sound console, you usually have to press a button or flip a switch that corresponds to that channel. Some sound consoles also have a bank of channel selector buttons, allowing you to quickly switch between different groups of channels.\nChannel gain: Channel gain is the first step in the signal processing chain in a sound console and refers to the adjustment of the level of an individual channel before it is mixed with other channels. It is used to control the overall volume of a specific audio source and is often represented by a rotary knob or a fader on the channel strip.\nIn summary, a sound console is a complex device that enables sound engineers and musicians to control, process, and mix multiple audio signals. Understanding the basic components and functions of a sound console is important for anyone working in the field of audio production.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#sound-engineering"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introduction to Mixing","level":1,"id":"Introduction_to_Mixing_0"},{"heading":"Different types of Engineers","level":2,"id":"Different_types_of_Engineers_0"},{"heading":"Using a Mixing Console","level":2,"id":"Using_a_Mixing_Console_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3-compendium/sound-engineering/03-introduction-to-mixing.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761405706387,"modifiedTime":1759973259713,"sourceSize":3155,"sourcePath":"3 - Compendium/Sound Engineering/03 - Introduction to Mixing.md","exportPath":"3-compendium/sound-engineering/03-introduction-to-mixing.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":7,"backlinks":["0-meta/indices/sound-engineering.html"],"type":"markdown"},"3-compendium/sound-engineering/04-making-audio-sound-good.html":{"title":"04 - Making Audio Sound Good","icon":"","description":"A sound console typically includes a variety of signal processing tools to shape and manipulate the sound of individual audio channels or groups of channels. Here is an overview of some common audio processing tools and effects:\nLow cut/high pass filter: A low cut (or high pass) filter is a type of frequency filter that allows frequencies above (or below) a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while reducing or cutting frequencies below (or above) the cutoff. This is useful for removing unwanted low-frequency rumble or high-frequency hiss.\nHigh cut/low pass filter: A high cut (or low pass) filter is the opposite of a low cut filter, allowing frequencies below (or above) a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while reducing or cutting frequencies above (or below) the cutoff.\nGate: A gate is a dynamic processing tool that opens or closes to allow or suppress audio signals below a certain threshold. Gates are commonly used to control noise or eliminate unwanted background noise.\nCompressor: A compressor is a dynamic processing tool that reduces the dynamic range of a signal by automatically reducing the volume of loud passages and increasing the volume of quiet passages. This is useful for balancing levels and preventing audio signals from clipping or becoming too loud.\nEQ: EQ (equalization) is the process of adjusting the balance between different frequency components within an audio signal. This can be used to enhance or reduce specific frequencies to shape the tonal quality of a sound.\nEffects: Effects are processing tools used to add special characteristics to audio signals. Some common effects include: Suboctaver: A suboctaver effect generates a lower pitch version of the input audio signal. Vocoder: A vocoder effect modulates the spectrum of one signal (typically a vocal input) using another signal (typically a synthesizer).\nChorus: A chorus effect creates a doubling effect by combining a delayed and pitch-modulated version of the input signal with the original.\nAmp simulation: An amp simulation effect models the sound of a guitar or bass amplifier.\nPhaser: A phaser effect creates a sweeping, phase-shifted version of the input signal.\nReverb: Reverb creates the impression of an acoustic space by adding a dense, decaying tail of echoes to the original sound.\nDelay: Delay creates a repetition of the input signal at a delayed time interval. Insert effects: Insert effects are processing tools that are applied to individual channels within a sound console. These effects are typically applied to the channel before it is mixed with other channels.\nBus effects: Bus effects are processing tools that are applied to groups of channels within a sound console. For example, you might use a bus effect to process a group of drum channels before they are mixed together.\nSide-chain effects: Side-chain effects use the level of one audio signal (the sidechain signal) to control the processing of another audio signal (the main signal). A common example of a side-chain effect is a ducking effect, where the level of the main signal is reduced whenever the sidechain signal reaches a certain threshold.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Making Audio Sound Good","level":1,"id":"Making_Audio_Sound_Good_0"},{"heading":"Where to Insert Effects","level":2,"id":"Where_to_Insert_Effects_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3-compendium/sound-engineering/04-making-audio-sound-good.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761405707170,"modifiedTime":1758400986878,"sourceSize":3259,"sourcePath":"3 - Compendium/Sound Engineering/04 - Making Audio Sound Good.md","exportPath":"3-compendium/sound-engineering/04-making-audio-sound-good.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":8,"backlinks":["0-meta/indices/sound-engineering.html"],"type":"markdown"},"3-compendium/sound-engineering/05-routing,-and-advanced-techniques.html":{"title":"05 - Routing, and Advanced Techniques","icon":"","description":"In a digital mixer, routing refers to the process of sending audio signals from one place to another within the mixer. The routing capabilities of a digital mixer can be quite complex and flexible, allowing for a wide range of signal processing and mixing options.\nBusses: Busses are virtual pathways within a digital mixer that allow audio signals to be combined and processed together. For example, you might use a bus to combine several channels of audio into a single stereo mix. Busses can be assigned to outputs such as speakers or headphones, or to processing tools such as effects.\nMatrices: Matrices are similar to busses, but allow for more complex signal routing options. With a matrix, you can route any channel or bus to any output or processing tool within the mixer. This can be useful for creating custom monitor mixes or for routing signals to multiple processing tools.\nDCAs (Digitally Controlled Amplifiers): DCAs are a type of group processing that allow you to control the level of multiple channels or busses with a single control. For example, you might use a DCA to control the level of all drum channels in a mix. DCAs can be especially useful in live sound reinforcement, where you need to make quick and accurate level adjustments to multiple channels at once.\nIn summary, routing in a digital mixer involves the assignment of audio signals to various pathways within the mixer, allowing you to control and process the signals as needed. Busses, matrices, and DCAs are some of the tools that can be used to control and manipulate the routing of audio signals in a digital mixer.Okay, this one's a bit advanced, but if you understand a few concepts about Psycho-acoustics (How music affects human psychology), you can easily make music that people can connect with.If you want to make music that people connect with, the first thing you need to know is how lower frequencies affect how people perceive music. If you've looked at the average human's frequency response curve, there's a sharp drop off below anything under 100hz. For the most part, anything under that threshold starts to become \"percusive\", it's sound that you can feel more than hear. Because of that, you can curate sound that feels like it has energy, it can be used to evoke strong emotional feelings in humans. Mid-bass (about 50-80hz) feels punchy, and can be felt in your head. Low-bass (about 30-50hz) can be felt in the chest and is described as \"fullness\" or as the \"bass body\". Ultra-low-bass (&lt;25hz) creates more of a pulsating feeling, and is tough to achieve with conventional sub-woofers making some resort to rotary sub-woofers.This one's a weird one that often bites sound engineers in the butt, but listening to music over and over slowly accustoms people to what that music sounds like. Most people with mild tinnitus can tune it out so it doesn't bother them, in the same way, listening to audio that sounds bad becomes the baseline after a while. You can use this knowledge in two ways, you can use it to make your audio sound better by taking breaks where you listen to something else so you can get a fresh set of ears on your sound, or you can use it to make any audience perceive that the performance is otherworldly by controlling what their baseline is. Yes, I'm talking about making the pre-recorded music often played in-between or before performances sound terrible; slap the most aggressive EQ on it and remove all the highs and lows, experiment with a wonky compressor to remove all the dynamics, so long as it's bad, your live show will sound great.You can use <a data-href=\"#Equal Loudness - Fletcher-Munson Curves\" href=\"#Equal Loudness - Fletcher-Munson Curves\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Equal Loudness - Fletcher-Munson Curves</a> to your advantage to mix in a way that sounds full and LOUD without making it painful to be in the room. As you noticed, our ears can take more lower end and high pitched sounds than that that 3k-5khz range. Which means you can push those sounds to be louder using your EQ, and trim out a bit of that mid range frequencies that hurt people's ears. Microphone placement: Experiment with different microphone placement techniques to find the best sound for each instrument or performer. Pay attention to factors such as distance, angle, and orientation to the source. Dynamic range compression: Use dynamic range compression to control the difference between the loudest and softest sounds in a mix. This can help to prevent distortion and ensure that the audio remains at a consistent level. Equalization: Use equalization (EQ) to shape the tone of individual sounds in a mix. For example, you can use high-pass filters to remove low-frequency rumble or boost high frequencies to add clarity. Reverb: Add reverb to create a sense of space and depth in a mix. Experiment with different reverb types and settings to find the best sound for each situation. Delay: Use delay to create a sense of spaciousness and depth in a mix. Experiment with different delay times and feedback levels to find the best sound for each situation. Automation: Use automation to make precise, repeatable changes to the levels and settings of individual sounds in a mix. For example, you can use automation to gradually bring up the volume of a guitar solo or fade out a vocal track. Stereo imaging: Use stereo imaging techniques to create a wider, more spacious soundstage. Experiment with panning, delay, and reverb to find the best sound for each situation. Sidechain compression: Use sidechain compression to control the level of one sound in relation to another. For example, you can use sidechain compression to reduce the volume of a bass line whenever a kick drum hits. Don’t be afraid to experiment. You will only succeed by the same measure you’re willing to fail. <br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.prosoundweb.com/in-the-studio-the-6-trouble-frequencies\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.prosoundweb.com/in-the-studio-the-6-trouble-frequencies\" target=\"_self\">EQ Problems</a> - Bobby Owsinski\n200Hz (Mud)&nbsp;– Too much can cause the track or the mix to sound muddy or boomy, while not enough of it can make it sound thin. It’s a fine line, but many times mixers err on the side of too much and end up with a track that’s too thick that clutters up the mix.\n300 to 500Hz (Boxy)&nbsp;– Too much of this frequency area results in the dreaded “boxiness” sound, or if you’re listening to a floor tom or kick, the “beach ball” effect. It’s also a spot that some less expensive microphones (especially dynamics) tend to emphasize, which is why many mixers almost automatically cut a a few dB of this area out of the kick drum during the mix.\n800Hz (Walmart)&nbsp;– Too much in this area results in what’s sometimes known as the “Walmart” sound, meaning that it sounds like a cheap stereo purchased in a department store. Try it for yourself – get a cheap pair of computer speakers and you’ll find that 800Hz is what you’ll mostly hear. Obviously, too much of this frequency range is not a good thing.\n1k to 1.5kHz (Nasal)&nbsp;– This is the nasal range of the frequency spectrum and, as the name suggests, too much results in a vocalist that sounds like she’s singing through her nose. Once again this is primarily a microphone problem in that it’s poorly matched to the vocalist, but notching a bit out during the mix can fix it.\n4kHz to 6kHz (Presence)&nbsp;– This frequency range is frequently underutilized during the mix, resulting in a track that lacks definition. Without it, things tend to sound dull, but too much can make the track sound thin or, in the case of a vocal, sibilant.\n10kHz+ (Air)&nbsp;– Another widely overlooked frequency band, this provides clarity and adds a certain “realness” to the track. Many vintage mics have a lot of the air frequencies, which is why we prize them for their sound. The Maag Audio EQ4P has a special “Air Band” designed to provide those frequencies with a minimum of phase shift, but you can dial it in other equalizers as well. Train your ears! These are just a few examples of advanced sound engineering techniques that you can use to enhance the audio quality of your live events and recordings. Keep in mind that each technique requires a different skill set and level of expertise, so it's important to experiment and practice to find the best results.If you want to make a wonderful sounding mix, I highly suggest looking at Bobby Owsinski’s work. He has several handbooks, webinars, and guides to help you create good sounding music.The 3:1 rule is a guideline for microphone placement that can help to reduce the likelihood of phase cancellations and the comb filtering effect. The rule states that the distance between two microphones should be at least three times the distance between each microphone and the source of sound.For example, if you're placing a microphone 1 foot away from a singer, the other microphone should be at least 3 feet away from both the singer and the first microphone. This distance helps to reduce the likelihood of phase cancellations and the comb filtering effect, which can occur when two microphones are picking up sound from the same source at different levels or times.By following the 3:1 rule, you can help to ensure that the sound captured by each microphone is as distinct as possible, reducing the likelihood of phase cancellations and the comb filtering effect. Keep in mind that this is just a general guideline, and the best microphone placement will vary depending on the specific situation.The inverse square law states that the intensity (or sound pressure level) of a point source decreases as the distance from the source increases. The intensity of the sound is proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\nwhere is the intensity of the sound, is the power of the source, pi is the mathematical constant (approximately equal to 3.14), and is the distance from the source.This means that as the distance from the source increases, the intensity of the sound decreases at a rate proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance. For example, if the distance from the source is doubled, the intensity of the sound will decrease to one-fourth of its original level.The inverse square law is a fundamental principle of acoustics and applies to all types of sound sources, including speakers, microphones, and other sound-emitting devices. Understanding this law is important for sound engineers, as it helps to predict how the intensity of sound will change based on the distance from the source, and to make informed decisions about microphone placement, speaker placement, and other aspects of sound reinforcement.This one's not as important in live environments, but if one of your inputs sound \"thin\" in the mix, and you want to make it sound like it's coming from a wider space, introduce a ~30ms delay in one of your stereo channels to make it sound wider. For Mono mixes, the Haas effect is a bit harder to pull off, but you can always duplicate the channel and pan one right, and the other left, and introduce a delay. You might have to tweak the timing so you don't get weird \"chorus-like\" artifacts or strange phase interactions.High-frequencies should be panned \"wider\" than lower frequencies because higher frequencies are more easily blocked by the head, which is why wide panned lower frequencies sound weird when wearing headphones.If you're struggling to find a way to get an instrument that don't have higher frequencies such as a Bass guitar to sound louder, try adding saturation to the lower-frequency sounds to create higher-frequency harmonics. This helps it sound fuller and more defined especially if the speakers are having a hard time replicating that low-frequency of a sound.Okay. This is just a rant on how important it is to know how the human ear perceives sound at different volumes. Yes, I'm talking about Fletcher-Munson curves; know them, understand them, use them. It should be noted that the red lines mean that the sound has to be that loud to hear it. and how loud it can be until it starts to cause pain. You can use that knowlege to make music LOUD<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20251116185025.png\" src=\"pasted-image-20251116185025.png\" target=\"_self\">Toss an EQ on your reverb and delay effects and trim out the higher ends to simulate the loss of higher frequencies as sound travels further. It's a subtle, organic, and ethically-sourced way to make your mixes sound more believable.It's pretty simple to understand that LOUD sounds make small sounds disappear. Mixing is a delicate balance to make every instrument and vocalist audible and blend together seamlessly. It's simple to just \"turn up\" the instrument that's quiet, but sometimes, it needs to be more subtle, sometimes you can just scoop out the frequencies of the acoustic guitar that's already covered by the electric guitar. You can just carve out frequency for different instruments to make each of them stand out.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Routing, and Advanced Techniques","level":1,"id":"Routing,_and_Advanced_Techniques_0"},{"heading":"Routing","level":2,"id":"Routing_0"},{"heading":"Psycho-acoustics","level":2,"id":"Psycho-acoustics_0"},{"heading":"The Importance of Lower Frequencies","level":3,"id":"The_Importance_of_Lower_Frequencies_0"},{"heading":"How to make nearly ANY live music sound GREAT","level":3,"id":"How_to_make_nearly_ANY_live_music_sound_GREAT_0"},{"heading":"Mixing Music LOUD","level":3,"id":"Mixing_Music_LOUD_0"},{"heading":"Advanced Techniques","level":2,"id":"Advanced_Techniques_0"},{"heading":"3:1 Rule","level":3,"id":"31_Rule_0"},{"heading":"Inverse Square Law","level":3,"id":"Inverse_Square_Law_0"},{"heading":"The Haas-Effect","level":3,"id":"The_Haas-Effect_0"},{"heading":"Spectral-Widening","level":3,"id":"Spectral-Widening_0"},{"heading":"Saturation for Translation","level":3,"id":"Saturation_for_Translation_0"},{"heading":"Equal Perceived Loudness and Fletcher-Munson Curves","level":3,"id":"Equal_Perceived_Loudness_and_Fletcher-Munson_Curves_0"},{"heading":"Make Reverb and Delay sound Natural","level":3,"id":"Make_Reverb_and_Delay_sound_Natural_0"},{"heading":"Masking Sounds","level":3,"id":"Masking_Sounds_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"3-compendium/sound-engineering/05-routing,-and-advanced-techniques.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["pasted-image-20251116185025.png"],"createdTime":1761405707868,"modifiedTime":1763345086219,"sourceSize":13407,"sourcePath":"3 - Compendium/Sound Engineering/05 - Routing, and Advanced Techniques.md","exportPath":"3-compendium/sound-engineering/05-routing,-and-advanced-techniques.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":9,"backlinks":["3-compendium/sound-engineering/05-routing,-and-advanced-techniques.html","0-meta/indices/sound-engineering.html"],"type":"markdown"},"3-compendium/sound-engineering/basic-festival-setup.html":{"title":"Basic Festival Setup","icon":"","description":"\nGreen: Vocalist (High Chance of Feedback)\nRed: Instrument (Medium Chance of Feedback)\nYellow: Originating from a computer (No Chance of feedback)\nPurple: Speaker with a headset microphone (Important, should take priority over Teal, high chance of feedback)\nTeal: Floating speaker with a handheld microphone (High Chance of Feedback)\nBlack: Unused/Standby Yellow: Originating from a computer\nBlack: Unused/Standby\nOrange: Destined to Be a direct output\nGreen: Meant for monitoring White: Multiple groups\nBlack: Unused/Standby\nOther: Follows other coloring standards.
